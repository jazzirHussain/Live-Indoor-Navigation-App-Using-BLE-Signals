# Indoor Navigation App Using BLE Signals

This Android app provides precise indoor navigation using **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** signals, designed for environments where GPS tracking is unreliable. It captures BLE signals from devices placed across the campus, triangulates the user's position, and provides live location updates, ensuring seamless navigation inside large buildings or campuses.

## Key Features

- **Live Indoor Positioning**: The app continuously captures BLE signals from strategically placed devices to provide real-time indoor tracking.
- **Triangulation for Accuracy**: Uses signal triangulation to calculate the user's exact location and updates the position on the app's interactive map.
- **Optimized for Indoor Environments**: Offers accurate navigation in indoor spaces where GPS signals are weak or unreliable, such as large campuses, malls, or office buildings.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive and clear interface for smooth navigation, displaying the user's position and destination on a map.

## Technology Stack

- **Android (Java/Kotlin)**: Core development environment for building the app.
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**: For capturing signals from BLE devices and triangulating the user's location.
- **Signal Processing Algorithms**: Triangulation algorithms are implemented to determine accurate positioning based on the strength and proximity of BLE signals.
- **Google Maps API**: Used for rendering the indoor map and providing a smooth navigation experience.

## Achievements

- **Reliable Indoor Navigation**: The app solves the problem of unreliable GPS signals inside buildings by leveraging BLE signals, providing accurate positioning for users.
- **Scalable Solution**: Can be deployed in large indoor environments, including campuses, hospitals, airports, and shopping malls.

## Future Scope

- **Scaling to Larger Venues**: The app can be expanded to more complex environments like **airports**, **hospitals**, or **multi-level buildings** by deploying additional BLE devices.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Further optimization of the triangulation algorithm for even more precise positioning.
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Future iterations could include AR overlays for improved indoor navigation, guiding users with visual cues.
